# Systems Analysis & Design

This repository contains all workshops, projects, and documentation for the "Analysis and Design of Systems" course.

## ðŸ“š About The Course

In this course, we will learn comprehensive systems analysis and design methodologies that enable us to analyze complex systems and develop effective solutions. Throughout the semester, we will explore requirements engineering, system modeling techniques, architectural design patterns, and implementation planning strategies. Professor Carlos AndrÃ©s Sierra leads this course at Francisco JosÃ© de Caldas District University during the 2025-1 academic term. This repository will contain all workshops, projects, and relevant notes as we progress through both theoretical concepts and practical applications in contemporary system development.
