## üîç Research Methodology

The research methodology employed in this project followed a systematic literature review approach:

1. **Initial Query Formulation**: The investigation began with broad search terms including "sleep state detection", "accelerometry sleep monitoring", and "psg sleep state" on Google Scholar.

2. **Iterative Refinement**: Search queries were progressively refined to include more specific terms such as "wrist-worn accelerometry validation", "machine learning sleep classification", and "polysomnography comparison studies".

3. **Citation Network Analysis**: Key papers were identified and their citation networks explored to discover seminal works and recent advancements in the field.

4. **Inclusion Criteria**: Selected literature met specific criteria including peer-reviewed status, methodological rigor, and relevance to accelerometry-based sleep detection.

5. **Theoretical Framework Development**: Based on the literature review, a comprehensive theoretical framework was constructed to guide the analysis and design of the sleep detection system.

## üî¨ Research Insights

The research identified several key insights:

- Accelerometry provides a viable, non-invasive alternative to traditional polysomnography for large-scale sleep monitoring and a non-invasive alternative for sleep state detection
- Machine learning approaches, particularly random forests and LSTM networks, demonstrate promising accuracy in sleep/wake classification
- The sensitivity-specificity tradeoff remains a significant challenge, with specificity (wake detection) consistently lower than sensitivity (sleep detection)
- Transition periods between sleep states present particular classification challenges for accelerometry-based methods
- Individual differences in movement patterns significantly impact algorithm performance, suggesting the need for personalized approaches
