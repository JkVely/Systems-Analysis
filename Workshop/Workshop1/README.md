# Workshop 1

## Overview

This workshop is a systemic analysis of the prized competition of Kaggle [Child Mind Institute - Detect Sleep States](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states), which consists of a system that detects
sleep states using accelerometers. The system is designed to analyze the data collected from accelerometers and
classify different sleep states based on the patterns observed in the data. The analysis includes a detailed examination
of the system's components, their interactions, and the emergent behaviors that emerges from these interactions.
By understanding the system's dynamics, we aim to identify potential areas for improvement and optimization, 
ultimately enhancing the accuracy and reliability of sleep state detection.

## Methodology

To analysis this kaggle competition we approach the problem studying the competition overview, requierements, goals and code 
examples given, looking for the inputs data and outputs expected. Since the competition has finished at the moment to analyze the problem, we check the winners solutions in order to get a better approach and understability to the problem, taking specially into account the second best solution which gives a significant system approach:

## Analysis steps

Approaching the problem following these top-down abstraction steps we create a robust model for detecting sleep states from accelerometer data. This involves classifying periods of sleep and wakefulness by analyzing time-series data from wearable sensors. The model should generalize well across individuals and account for variations in sleep patterns to provide insights into sleep and potential sleep disorders. Ultimately, the goal is to improve awareness and guidance surrounding the importance of sleep.

- System elements : How the systems is compound by enough elements with its specific task in order to get the main goal of the system
- Elements interactions: How elements are related in order to reach process that aim the main goal
- Emergent behaviours : How the differents process works together to generate the behaviour of the system
